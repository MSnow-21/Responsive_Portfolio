Description:

The Responsive Portfolio is a website consisting of a Portfolio, About-Me, and Contact page. The application gives the user an easy way to look at the Mark Snow's project profile, projects that Mark has developed, and a contact page to connect with Mark. The html files utilize responsive web design so users can view the Portfolio on a range of devices. Each html file has been formated using containers to create rows and columns to quickly adapt to the different viewport sizes.

The deployed link immediately takes the user to the About-Me page where a short biography is detailed. The Portfolio and Contact pages can be accessed from this page via the "Portfolio" and "Contact" links on the Navigation Bar. The Portfolio page provides a list of projects Mark has worked on during his time at Bootcampspot. Projects are shown as pictures acting as clickable links that take the user to those deployed links and Github repositories. The third page is a Contact page that allows the user to contact Mark by submitting their name, e-mail, and a note. The Portfolio and Contact pages both have links in the Navbar that can take you to any of the three pages avaible. Clicking on "Mark Snow" in the Navbar immediately takes the user home to the About-Me page.
